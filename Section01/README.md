Some *italic* and **bold** text and `inline code`.

An empty line starts a new paragraph.

Use two spaces at the end  
to force a line break.

A horizontal ruler follows:

---

Add links inline like [this link to the Qt homepage](https://www.qt.io),
or with a reference like [this other link to the Qt homepage][1].

    Add code blocks with
    four spaces at the front.

> A blockquote
> starts with >
>
